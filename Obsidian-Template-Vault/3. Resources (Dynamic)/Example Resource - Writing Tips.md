# Writing Tips

> **This is an example resource note.** Use it as a template for your own reference materials.

## Overview

A collection of writing tips, techniques, and best practices for academic and technical writing.

## Core Principles

### Clarity First

- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences for complex ideas
- Define terms before using them
- Use active voice when possible

### Structure Matters

1. **Tell them what you'll tell them** (intro)
2. **Tell them** (body)
3. **Tell them what you told them** (conclusion)

### Revision is Key

> "Writing is rewriting." - Every good writer ever

- First draft: Get ideas down
- Second draft: Organize and clarify
- Third draft: Polish and refine

## Academic Writing Specifics

### Paper Structure

| Section | Purpose | Tips |
|---------|---------|------|
| Abstract | Summarize everything | Write last, 150-300 words |
| Introduction | Set context, state contribution | End with paper outline |
| Related Work | Position your work | Group by theme, not chronology |
| Method | How you did it | Enough detail to reproduce |
| Results | What you found | Let data speak, minimal interpretation |
| Discussion | What it means | Connect to intro, acknowledge limits |
| Conclusion | Key takeaways | Future work, broader impact |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- [ ] Passive voice overuse
- [ ] Undefined acronyms
- [ ] Unsupported claims

- [ ] Inconsistent terminology

## Useful Phrases

## How Resources Work

### What Makes Something a Resource?

A resource is:
1. **Reference material** - Information you refer back to
2. **Topic-based** - Organized by subject, not time
3. **Evergreen** - Stays relevant over time

### Common Resource Types

- **How-to guides** - Processes and procedures
- **Reference sheets** - Quick lookups
- **Collections** - Curated lists of links/tools
- **Knowledge notes** - Synthesized learning
- **Templates** - Reusable formats

### Organizing Resources

Consider creating subfolders by topic:
```
3. Resources (Dynamic)/
├── Writing/
├── Research Methods/
├── Tools & Software/
├── Domain Knowledge/
└── Templates/
```

### When to Create a Resource

Create a resource when you:
- Learn something you'll need again
- Find yourself explaining the same thing
- Discover a useful tool or process
- Want to synthesize multiple sources

### Resource vs Area

| Aspect | Resource | Area |
|--------|----------|------|
| Purpose | Reference | Responsibility |
| Action | Consult | Maintain |
| Example | "Writing Tips" | "Research" |
