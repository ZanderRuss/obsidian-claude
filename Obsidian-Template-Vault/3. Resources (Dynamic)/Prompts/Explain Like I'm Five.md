# Explain Like I'm Five

## Purpose

Get clear, simple explanations of complex topics using analogies and everyday language.

## Prompt

```
Explain {topic} like I'm five years old.

Use:
- Simple words and short sentences
- Everyday analogies and comparisons
- A concrete example I can visualize
- No jargon (or explain it simply if needed)

After the simple explanation, give me 3 levels:
1. ELI5 (what you just did)
2. ELI15 (high school level)
3. ELI-Expert (technical summary)
```

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{topic}` | Complex topic to explain | "quantum computing" |

## Usage Notes

- Great for building intuition before diving deep
- Use when learning fundamentals of new field
- Save explanations as flashcards
- Good for teaching others

## Examples

### Example 1: Technical Concept

**Input:**
```
Explain machine learning like I'm five years old.

Use:
- Simple words and short sentences
- Everyday analogies and comparisons
- A concrete example I can visualize
- No jargon (or explain it simply if needed)

After the simple explanation, give me 3 levels:
1. ELI5 (what you just did)
2. ELI15 (high school level)
3. ELI-Expert (technical summary)
```

**Output:**
**ELI5**: "Machine learning is like teaching a dog tricks. You show the dog what to do over and over, and give treats when it gets it right. Eventually, the dog learns! Computers can learn the same way - we show them lots of examples, and they figure out the patterns."
