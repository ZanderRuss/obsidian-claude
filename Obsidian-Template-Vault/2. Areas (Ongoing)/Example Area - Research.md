## How Areas Work

### What Makes Something an Area?

An area has:
1. **No end date** - It's an ongoing responsibility
2. **Standards to maintain** - Quality levels you want to uphold
3. **Regular attention** - Needs periodic review

### Common Areas for Researchers

- **Research** - Your main research work
- **Teaching** - Courses, mentoring, supervision
- **Health** - Physical and mental wellbeing
- **Finance** - Grants, budgets, personal finance
- **Professional Development** - Skills, networking, career
- **Administration** - Department duties, committees

### Area Reviews

Use `/weekly-synthesis` to review your areas and ensure you're maintaining standards.

### Area vs Project

| Aspect | Area | Project |
|--------|------|---------|
| End date | No | Yes |
| Outcome | Standards | Deliverable |
| Duration | Ongoing | Temporary |
| Example | "Research" | "Submit paper to NeurIPS" |
