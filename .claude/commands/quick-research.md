## Process

1. **Understand the request**
   - Clarify if ambiguous
   - Identify 2-3 key questions

2. **Rapid search**
   - Use WebSearch for current information
   - Check vault for existing related notes
   - Gather 5-10 diverse sources

3. **Quick synthesis**
   - Key points (bullets, not prose)
   - Notable links/resources
   - Open questions for follow-up

## Output Format

## Quick vs Complete Research

| Aspect | Quick Research | Complete Research |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Sources | 5-10 | 20+ (minimum 12 peer-reviewed) |
| Phases | 1 | 6 |
| Quality gates | None | Mandatory fact-check |
| Output | Single file | Phased folder structure |
| Use case | Exploration | Publication/thesis |

## When to Use

- Exploring a new topic casually
- Background research for a meeting
- Understanding before committing to deep work
- Time-constrained investigations

## When NOT to Use

- Academic publications requiring citations
- Thesis or dissertation work
- Systematic literature reviews
- Any work that will be peer-reviewed

For rigorous research, use `/deep-research` with `/research-project-init` instead.
